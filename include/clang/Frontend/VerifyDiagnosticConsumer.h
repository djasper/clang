/// VerifyDiagnosticConsumer - Create a diagnostic client which will use
/// markers in the input source to check that all the emitted diagnostics match
/// those expected.
///
/// USING THE DIAGNOSTIC CHECKER:
///
/// Indicating that a line expects an error or a warning is simple. Put a
/// comment on the line that has the diagnostic, use:
///
///     expected-{error,warning,note}
///
/// to tag if it's an expected error or warning, and place the expected text
/// between {{ and }} markers. The full text doesn't have to be included, only
/// enough to ensure that the correct diagnostic was emitted.
///
/// Here's an example:
///
/// \code
///   int A = B; // expected-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'B'}}
/// \endcode
///
/// You can place as many diagnostics on one line as you wish. To make the code
/// more readable, you can use slash-newline to separate out the diagnostics.
///
/// Alternatively, it is possible to specify the line on which the diagnostic
/// should appear by appending "@<line>" to "expected-<type>", for example:
///
///   #warning some text
///   // expected-warning@10 {{some text}}
///
/// The line number may be absolute (as above), or relative to the current
/// line by prefixing the number with either '+' or '-'.
///
/// The simple syntax above allows each specification to match exactly one
/// error.  You can use the extended syntax to customize this. The extended
/// syntax is "expected-<type> <n> {{diag text}}", where \<type> is one of
/// "error", "warning" or "note", and \<n> is a positive integer. This allows
/// the diagnostic to appear as many times as specified. Example:
///
/// \code
///   void f(); // expected-note 2 {{previous declaration is here}}
/// \endcode
///
/// Regex matching mode may be selected by appending '-re' to type. Example:
///
///   expected-error-re
///
/// Examples matching error: "variable has incomplete type 'struct s'"
///
///   // expected-error {{variable has incomplete type 'struct s'}}
///   // expected-error {{variable has incomplete type}}
///
///   // expected-error-re {{variable has has type 'struct .'}}
///   // expected-error-re {{variable has has type 'struct .*'}}
///   // expected-error-re {{variable has has type 'struct (.*)'}}
///   // expected-error-re {{variable has has type 'struct[[:space:]](.*)'}}
